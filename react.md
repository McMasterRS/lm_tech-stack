## React or any React Derivative

React makes it painless to create interactive user interfaces. Design simple views for each state in the application and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when the source data changes. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make more complex interfaces.  

One of the main benefits of using React is its community. The React community provides a lot of documentations on learning the framework as well as functional components so saving the time for other developers to write their own codes for the same features. The React framework documentation is also quite detailed and provides the necessary support for experienced React developers as well as newcomers to the framework. Most React derivative frameworks also enjoy a good deal of support from their online communities and provide relatively detailed documentation. Developers hoping to familiarize themselves with React or any of its derivate frameworks can also find a good number of books written by professional software developers who have been using these frameworks for an extended period of time.
