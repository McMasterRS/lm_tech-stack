## Material UI

Material UI is an open source React component library that implements Google's [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/). It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box. The library includes an extensive set of intuitive customizability features.  

Since the framework implements Material Design, the components are clean and modern by default and responsive in both web and mobile platforms.  

Material UI also makes it easy to style components by changing the colour, shape, and fonts used in these components. This feature allows the developers to adopt the McMaster branding on their website with relative ease.  

The official Material UI documentation is very detailed and provides an extensive overview of each component provided by the library. Each component’s page contains several code snippets that showcase its usage. Given Material UI’s popularity, developers can also find unofficial documentation guides and tutorials online.  

Since Material UI uses Google’s Material Design, it provides several tools to ensure that the UI scales properly on all devices that a user could use to access the website (e.g., desktop monitors, laptops, tablets, and smartphones).  

Lastly, Material UI is often updated with each iteration of Google’s Material Design language, so it continues to adhere to the latest industry standards in terms of aesthetics, functionality, and accessibility.
