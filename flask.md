Flask is a lightweight Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) web application framework. It is designed to make the process of creating RESTful APIs quick and easy, with a limited ability to scale up complex applications. Flask offers a very comprehensive documentation, with coverage of basic to advanced web development topics, making it very easy for new developers to learn how to use the framework.  

An ideal use case of Flask would be for building rapid prototypes for testing.
