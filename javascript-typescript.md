TypeScript is a modern age JavaScript development language. It is a statically typed language to write clear JavaScript code. Typescript can generally provide you more robust software due to its nature of better code structuring and object-oriented programming techniques. However, there are still several reasons to opt for an older JavaScript flavour then TypeScript:  

1. JavaScript is a flexible and easy to learn scripting language. While TypeScript has a stiffer learning curve and requires prior scripting knowledge.  
2. JavaScript built a larger community than TypeScript, hence developers can get more support in the JavaScript community than the TypeScript community.
